Road damage can pose significant economic, safety,
and environmental challenges. The proposed solution uses
advanced image processing techniques, machine learning algorithms,
and statistical analysis to accurately identify different
types of road damage such as cracks, potholes, and surface
deterioration.
From an economic point of view, detecting road damage
is very important to enable timely repairs and maintenance.
Poor road conditions can lead to higher vehicle maintenance
costs, lower fuel efficiency, and higher transportation costs. By
detecting damage early, transportation authorities can prioritize
repairs, allocate resources effectively, and minimize the financial
burden on individuals and businesses. From a safety perspective,
road damage detection plays an important role in preventing
accidents and injuries. Potholes and cracks can cause tire
blowouts, loss of vehicle control, and crashes. Timely detection
and repair of such damage reduces the risk of accidents and
improves traffic safety for drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists.
In addition, efficient road damage detection can also benefit
the environment. Well-maintained roads reduce fuel consumption
and greenhouse gas emissions from congestion associated
with long-term repairs. By detecting damage early, the system
will enable authorities to plan and implement remediation
strategies that minimize environmental impact and contribute
to sustainable transport infrastructure.

To overcome these challenges, many transportation companies
are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to improve
the efficiency and effectiveness of road damage detection.
Using AI algorithms and machine learning techniques like YOLO, to 
automatically detect and classify various types of road
damage with high accuracy. This reduces the time and
resources required to identify road damage, improving road
safety and vehicle reliability.
